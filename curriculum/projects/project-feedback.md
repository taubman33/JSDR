# Providing Project Feedback
> _Every student should have the chance to understand how they're doing, and get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors like us._

**Doing 1-on-1 code reviews with an instructor and receive feedback is so, so important to a student's progress.**

There will undoubtedly be nuances in how we evaluate final projects given the simple fact that every project is different – but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to have an organized & direct way to do it.

## Guiding Principles

**The goal of providing feedback on student projects is to give personal guidance to each student, including meaningful suggestions and input that isn’t immediately obvious.**

- **30 minutes of feedback with an instructor** will hopefully be enough time to go over project code and discuss the instructor’s evaluation of their project.
- **Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt**
- The rubric is based on a **simple 3-point scale**
- **The actual measurement for “meets expectation” is tied to the project prompt, and will be different by project**

> **Note:** Scores like 1.5 are okay, but there's no sense in getting crazy – a score like 1.78 is too detailed to know how to handle as a student.

#### Code Review: Guide

**Each student should have 30 minutes to review their project evaluation and do a code review with an instructor sometime during the week after a project is completed. Most times, the first "student" portion will be in the form of a presentation (but much shorter!)**

*Make sure you frame this time to the students* – this is not troubleshooting time, we’re just reviewing code and talking about actionable feedback for enhancing the project in the future.

- **Student** *(10 mins)*:  Have the student walk through and defend their code.

- **Student** *(10 mins)*:  Have the student answer the following questions.

  - What do you like most about your app?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?
  - What were some of your challenges while building this app?


- **Instructor** *(10 mins)*:  Talk through the evaluation, and share a “glow and grow”.

  - Make it personal – what about the app was exciting or intriguing for you as a user?
  - Share highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, project approach
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. **Set 1 or 2 specific goals for the next project.** If you’re reviewing the second or third project with the student, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously!

**Be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your team, producer, and city lead.** Everyone should be able to have a good idea of how the whole class is doing if we split it up and share our findings!
