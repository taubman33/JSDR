> We have 3 Unit Projects in JS, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course. Our projects each have an objective, deliverables, and recommendations, and tie in to the overall competencies we focus on in each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec file to read more about each project and read about our curriculum.

See the [feedback guidelines](project-feedback.md) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.


### **Project 1: Slackbot**

For our first project, we are going to keep things simple. We will build a Slackbot on top of the popular Github bot called [Hubot](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack). Hubot is a robot that was created by GitHub, that automates their company chat. Hubot can deploy their site, be a source of fun comments and also can automate a lot of their daily tasks. It is powerful, but it is also built in a way that we can build whatever we want on top of it.

Hubot scripts are generally written in CoffeeScript, which is a JavaScript scripting language. They also take vanilla JavaScript, which is what we will be using. Your bot can respond to whatever you like, but should do at least 3 different things.

  - **Goal**: Build a Slackbot that can respond to user input.
  - **Project Time**: 4 days

### **Project 2: Feedr**

For our Unit 2 project we will build __Feedr__, a personalized feed reader. Online
feeds are like to-do lists in that they can be infinitely personalized and there is not
one solution that works for everybody. Our feed reader will pull feeds from our favorite blogs. The user will be able to filter between publications through the dropdown on the header menu.
Clicking/tapping on one of the articles will load a pop up with more
information. The user from that point will be able to either dismiss the
additional information or go to the referenced article.

  - **Goal**: Build a personalized feed reader that can pull from 3 news sources, load snippets, and manage user interactions.
  - **Project Time**: 6 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](unit2/project-02.md)**


### **Project 3: Portfolio Project**
For the final project, you'll be designing and building a single page web application of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio. You could create anything from: a blog users can comment on; an app that allows users to search for social media posts; or even an application that logs users geolocations. Work with your instructor to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

- **Goal**: Develop and build a production ready single page app hosted live on the web.
- **Project Time**: 6 days

### Project Submissions: Unit 1 and Final Project

* Using [these](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) docs and/or what you learned from class:

  * create a new local repository
  * create a repository on GitHub
  * link your local and remote repositories
  * add any starter code to your local repository (this is not described in the docs)
  * push your work to GitHub

* Once you have pushed your work to GitHub, be sure to send your project's GitHub URL to your instructional team

### Project Submission: Unit 2

* Create a fork of [this](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/JS-Unit-2-Project-Starter-Code) repository that describes the Unit 2 project
* Clone your forked repository using [these docs](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and/or what you learned from class
* Work! While your working be sure to:

  * `git add .` to add all of your changes to your repository
  * `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your changes locally
  * `git push origin master` to push your changes to your own fork!

* Once you are finished coding, inside of your fork on GitHub, create a new pull request.
