#### Signing Up For 500px Credentials

The first step in working with a third-party API that requires authentication is to register your application with the API. The purpose of this is so that the API, in this case 500px, can give our app credentials to use in future requests so it can recognize who is asking for what information. Let's go ahead and get our credentials.

First and foremost, you must have a 500px account. If you don't already have one, please [sign up](https://500px.com/signup). Once you are signed in, visit 500px's [settings page](https://500px.com/settings/applications). Register your application by clicking on _Applications_ in the left hand menu and then the _Register your application_ button.

You should see the following:

After you fill out the form you'll have:

Most of the fields values should be pretty self-explanatory. However, _JavaScript SDK Callback URL_ may not be as obvious. After our user leaves our app to log in to 500px, 500px redirects them back to our app with the access token. So how does 500px know where to send the authenticated user? Well that input value, `http://localhost:3000/callback.html`, is how. We have not yet covered what `http://localhost:3000` is, but for now just know that it is the URI that our app will be connected to and so it is the URI we want 500px to redirect back to.

> Note: Make sure students don't miss the colon (":") in `http://localhost:3000`. This will likely trip up some students who haven't run a local server before!

You should now see the application you created on your dashboard. Click on _See application details_.

You should now see `JavaScript SDK Key` and other information pertaining to your new app on the expanded view. In order to obtain an access token for our app, we must pass the `JavaScript SDK Key` of our app in our access token request to 500px. Take note of this SDK key because we'll need it in just a little bit. Once again, the reason 500px wants you to pass this credential with your request, is so that they can track which third-party application (our application) is associated with which access token. Go ahead and glance at the [OAuth Authentication](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/blob/master/authentication/POST_oauth_accesstoken.md) and [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/500px/500px-js-sdk) documentation to get a more detailed understanding on how we'll go about getting our token.

You're now ready to start working with the 500px API during our next class!
