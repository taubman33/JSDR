This session is meant to provide the instructional team with an opportunity to develop an original lesson based on demand from students. You might choose to review concepts students have had difficulty with, introduce a new concept that you think will be useful for them, or teach a concept that students have inquired about but which is not covered in the curriculum. Feel free to poll your students in advance of this lesson, to get a feel for topics that may be of interest.

If you are in need of material to cover, we've prepared [a sample lesson](angular.md) on Angular.js. This lesson is designed to provide students with a high-level overview of Angular: what problems it solves, what it can do, some basic code examples. Most students will not be able to use Angular in their final projects after this lesson--the idea is just to provide an introduction that students can use as a springboard for future learning. Feel free to adapt this lesson to cover another JavaScript framework be it React, Ember, Backbone or another framework that you or your students are interested in.

If you do develop an original lesson on a different topic, please feel free to contribute it back to this folder as a separate markdown file (similar to the Angular lesson). Please see our [contribution guidelines](../../../contributing.md) for information on how to file a pull request, as well as our markdown template and style guide.
