## Lab Time

This session is meant to provide students with time to work on their final projects. During this time, the members of the instructional team should circulate through the room, helping students who are stuck and answering any questions they might have.

Based on student needs, you can choose to start off the lab session by reviewing a concept that students had difficulty with, covering something that you didn't have time to get to in a previous lesson or briefly introducing a new topic. If you want some new material to cover, we've prepared lessons on [ECMAScript 6](es6/es6.md) and [HTML5 canvas](canvas/canvas.md)--each lesson clocks in at a little over an hour. Ultimately, it is left to the discretion of the instructor how to make the best use of time in this session.
