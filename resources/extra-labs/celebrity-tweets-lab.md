### Overview

<a name = "lab"></a>
For today's class you'll be creating a full-stack app that implements all of the skills you have gathered over this past unit.

The app you'll be creating will be a SPA that allows users to upvote and downvote celebrity tweets based off of their comedic value. The first page of your single page application will have a search input where users can find the latest tweets of their favorite celebrities. When the tweet results are returned for the user in the view, the user should be able to save which ones he/she thinks are funny. All saved tweets will appear on a second page of your SPA where they can then be upvoted and downvoted upon.

### Technical requirements:

- Your application should be a SPA consisting of two views.
- Integrate the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).
- Bind data to the DOM.
- Use Parse to set up your back-end.
- Implement CRUD functionality.

### Bonus Tasks:

- Implement login functionality with OAuth.
- Order saved celebrity tweets by their votes.
